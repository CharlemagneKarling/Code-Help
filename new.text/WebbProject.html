		<h1>Coding Benefits</h1>
		<p>Use your time wisely, and pick something that suits you</p>
	<div class="fea-base">

			<h3>Screen Time</h3>
			<p>Yes, your screen time might increase heavily as you aim to become a well educated Scripter and work within the Programming Industry, but it's all going to be worth it, as the future keeps moving, everything is being done digitally. Money is made virtually online, and we're constantly being dependent on the internet. Besides, the benefits that come with being a Programmer is almost endless, especially if it's within your own hobby.

			<h3>Job Opportunities</h3>
			
			<p>
				As the word continues to become more dependent on the internet, the different sources of income through the internet becomes all the more wider. Now if you're a persistent coder, and you've fully mastered for example both Lua and C#, you will not only have tons of Job Opportunities infront of you, but you'll also be able to start something of your own, something of your own interest, and possibly make it a driving business.

			<h3>Education</h3>
			
			<p>
				Education is key!
				Educate yourself effectively with MinCodeNet by following the adapt courses that I went through, step by step to work yourself up and eventually become educated in both the languages C# and Lua, don't waste your time going to Guides that only want to waste your time and have you work ineffectively. Also, don't be afraid to try more languages, the more you're familiar with. The easier it's going to be to learn new ones.
